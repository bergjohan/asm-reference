# asm-reference

A list of concepts needed to become fluent in x86-64 assembly. Each directory
contains a concept illustrated by small working code examples. The examples
follow the [System V Application Binary
Interface](https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf) and are written for
the [GNU Assembler](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/as/) (in both AT&T and
Intel syntax), and [NASM - The Netwide
Assembler](https://www.nasm.us/xdoc/2.14.02/html/nasmdoc0.html). There are also
tests written in C for each of the examples.
